# Casey Nguyen's Personal Website

This repository holds the files that run my personal [website](https://caseynguyen.github.io/). Currently, this only holds my resume and is run
by the index.html file, which is supported by the style.css template.

Pardon how the code looks, I learned HTML and CSS in a day and I figured this would be a fun side-project work on.

The color palette of this website is specially-curated by [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).

Special thanks to GitHub Pages for powering this site!
