# Casey Nguyen's Personal Website

This repository holds the files that run my personal [website](https://caseynguyen.github.io/). Currently, this only holds my resume and is run
by the index.html file, which is supported by the style.css template.

headshot.jpg is taken by the artsy [Marisah Goo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marisahgoo/), I highly recommend her for professional-grade photos!

The color palette of this website is specially-curated by [Coolors](https://coolors.co/).

Special thanks to GitHub Pages for powering this site!
