        <p style = "font-family: Arial">Third-year computer science major at Seattle University with a passion for
            learning. Extensive background using C++ and Python, allowing me to learn
            various coding programs, detect and rectify errors in said programs to ensure they
            work properly. Through high marks and diligence, I know I can hone my skills in
            any working environment.</p>
