	<p>I'm Casey, and I'm a first-generation Asian-American college student from Hawaii.
	<br><br>
	Growing up, I wanted to be the President. Then, I learned that it took a little
	more than just being nice to everyone to be the POTUS, so I had to switch gears.
	<br><br>
	My passion for programming began in sixth grade with Scratch. 
	Creating games and animations out of little blocks of code resonated with
	my young mind. Feel free to look through the legendary catalog
	of <a href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/users/holy_mac_808/">holy_mac_808</a>.
	<br><br>
	I have an interest in databases and game design. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science 
	in <b>Computer Science</b> at Seattle University. I'm also looking to finish a Minor in Data
	Science and Mathematics.
